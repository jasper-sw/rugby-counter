# Rugby gear run counter scripts
 - These are two python scripts I wrote to help me organize data and format output as 
I've been orchestrating a custom gear run and custom rugby ball run with vendors for
the team. These scripts take the csvs created by the google forms we sent to players 
as input and produce formatted output.
 - The first script, "rugby_counter.py" takes the csv from the google form where we asked players about their 
 item sizing and formats the information in a way that's easy to read so that we could send it to our vendor.
  - The second script, "rugby_counter_second.py", looks at a csv of venmo payments we've recieved and cross-references these
  with the csv tracking ball quantity orders on a person by person basis. This allows us to see who has paid, who hasn't, and 
  how much they still owe.
